# XML-Programming

Files to be created:
1 xml file(.xml)
2. Schema file( .xsd)
3. DTD(.dtd)
To validate an XML document, a schema must be created. This can be done with a DTD (Document Type Definition) and a Java based XML DOM (Document Object Model) parser.

Implement Java with the Standard library, and the source code must be named DomParserSchema. 
The parser must be used to validate the XML document against the DTD, 
the source code must be named DomParserDTD or dom_parser_dtd.

##How to run
Run DomParserSchema.java to test xml file(boookstore.xml) against the schema (bookstoreschem.xsd)

Run DomParserDTD.java to test xml file(boookstore.xml) against the DTD file (bookstore.dtd)
